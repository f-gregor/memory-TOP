# **Memory - The Odin Project**

In this assignment I am required to create a Memory game in React making use of the useEffect Hook.

I decided to use the lorcana-api to fetch the urls of specific Disney Lorcana cards, whose art will be featured on the memory cards. The UI is in Italian as I plan to use it as a game for my nephew!
